## Quick Start

### üåê Web Version (Easiest)
Visit: https://turner-engineering.github.io/reda/

### üíª Local Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Optimizes the build for best performance with minified files.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## How to Use

1. **Open Folder**: Click on panel titles or empty states to select CSV file folders
2. **Load Data**: Select CSV files from your EMC testing equipment
3. **Analyze**: View automatic band detection and noise analysis
4. **Compare**: Load datasets in both panels for side-by-side comparison
5. **Export**: Generate professional charts for reports and documentation

## CSV Format

Your EMC test files should contain frequency and amplitude columns:

```csv
Frequency (MHz),Amplitude (dBŒºV/m)
30.0,65.2
30.1,64.8
30.2,63.9
...
```

Supported formats:
- Frequency in Hz, kHz, MHz, or GHz
- Amplitude in dBŒºV/m or similar units
- Headers are automatically detected

## EMC Frequency Bands

REDA automatically detects and categorizes data by EMC frequency bands:

- **B0**: 0.15-0.5 MHz
- **B1**: 0.5-5 MHz  
- **B2**: 5-30 MHz
- **B3**: 30-100 MHz
- **B4**: 100-300 MHz
- **B5**: 300-1000 MHz
- **B6**: 1-3 GHz
- **B7**: 3-18 GHz
