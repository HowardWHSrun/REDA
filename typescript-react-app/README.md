# REDA EMC Testing Tool - TypeScript React Application

## Overview
This is the **modern TypeScript React implementation** of the REDA EMC Testing Tool for Turner Engineering Corporation. This represents the current development version with professional UI/UX, modern architecture, and enhanced functionality.

## Current Features (Implemented)
- âœ… **Professional Folder Browser System**: File System Access API integration
- âœ… **Two-Dataset Comparison**: Side-by-side spectrum analysis
- âœ… **Smart Band Detection**: Automatic frequency band identification (B0-B7)
- âœ… **Professional Visualization**: Chart.js-based spectrum plotting
- âœ… **High-Resolution Export**: 300 DPI PNG exports with metadata
- âœ… **Color-Coded Interface**: Blue/Orange panel system for dataset distinction
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Full viewport utilization with responsive layout
- âœ… **TypeScript Safety**: Complete type checking and interfaces

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **React 19.1.0**: Modern functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript 4.9.5**: Type-safe development
- **Chart.js 4.5.0**: Professional data visualization
- **File System Access API**: Modern browser file handling
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Dynamic theming system
