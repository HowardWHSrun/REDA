# Reference Materials

## Overview
This directory contains **reference documentation and regulatory materials** used in the development and operation of the EMC Testing Tools for Turner Engineering Corporation.

## Files

### `FCC Chart.pdf`
**FCC Frequency Allocation Chart**
- Official regulatory reference for frequency band allocations
- Used for compliance verification and band identification
- Essential reference for EMC testing validation
- Covers complete spectrum from VLF to SHF

### `Table of Frequency Allocations Excel.xlsx`
**Detailed Frequency Allocation Database**
- Comprehensive Excel database of frequency allocations
- Detailed breakdown by band, service type, and regulations
- Cross-references with FCC Parts and ITU Radio Regulations
- Source data for the automated band identification systems

## Usage in EMC Testing

### Regulatory Compliance
These materials ensure that EMC testing tools properly identify and categorize frequency allocations according to:
- **FCC Regulations**: Federal Communications Commission rules
- **ITU Radio Regulations**: International Telecommunications Union standards
- **Industry Standards**: Professional EMC testing requirements

### Band Database Development
The Excel file serves as the authoritative source for:
- Peak identification database generation
- Frequency band boundary definitions (B0-B7)
- Service allocation categorization
- Regulatory footnote references

### Quality Assurance
These references are used to:
- Validate automated band detection algorithms
- Verify peak identification accuracy
- Ensure regulatory compliance in test reports
- Cross-check frequency allocation assignments

## Integration with EMC Tools

### Legacy JavaScript Version
- Frequency data compiled into 8 band database files
- Peak identification algorithms reference these allocations
- Export reports include proper regulatory citations

### TypeScript React Version
- Modern implementation uses these same reference standards
- Band detection algorithms validated against official charts
- Professional reporting maintains regulatory compliance

## Document Maintenance
These reference materials should be updated periodically to reflect:
- Changes in FCC frequency allocations
- Updates to ITU Radio Regulations
- New service allocations or band plan modifications
- Industry standard revisions
